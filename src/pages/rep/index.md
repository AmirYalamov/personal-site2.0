# First Year Representative

<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="/img/CSUS Logo" width="120" height="120" alt="HADP Logo">

<p>In my first year at university I wanted to get involved in the CS community at Western.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">As the first year rep, I acted as the liaison between the club and all the first year students. I was also part of the sub-committee that rewrote the organization's constitution, in order to establish a framework for success and growth for the club's future.
      <br><br>Some of the initiatives I took:<br>
      <ul>
      <li>Plan and execute an Intel machine learning workshop</li>
      <li>Promote a professors vs. students CS themed trivia night</li>
      <li>Advertise and carry out sweater sales</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
