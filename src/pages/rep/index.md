# First Year Representative

<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="/img/CSUS Logo" width="120" height="120" alt="HADP Logo">

In my first year at university I wanted to get involved in the CS community at Western.

As the first year rep, I acted as the liaison between the club and all the first year students. I was also part of the sub-committee that rewrote the organization's constitution, in order to establish a framework for success and growth for the club's future.

Some of the initiatives I took included **planning and executing an Intel machine learning workshop**, **promoting a professors vs. students CS themed trivia night**, and **advertising and carrying out merchandise sales**.
