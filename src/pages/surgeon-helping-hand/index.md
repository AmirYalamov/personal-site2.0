<p>DeltaHacks Best Healthcare Hack Award winner. </p>
    <p class="mb-0">Our team built a platform for surgeons to perform remote surgery over the internet. This consisted of a web interface and a robotic hand that could be controlled by an infrared sensor that maps out your hand and tracks your motions. <br><br>
      We used the following technologies:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>LeapMotion and LeapMotion API</li>
    <li>Arduino</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
