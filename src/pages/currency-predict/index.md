#### Made with CryptoCompare API, NumPy library, Keras library, and Python

 Over my winter break in 2017 I developed an interest in cryptocurrency, and I built a machine learning program that would predict the future closing price of any given cryptocurrency.

I did this by feeding closing price data from a cryptocurrency exchange API into a Multilayer Perceptron model.
