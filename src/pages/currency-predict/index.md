<br>
    <p> Over my winter break in 2017 I developed an interest in cryptocurrency, and I built a machine learning program that would predict the future closing price of any given cryptocurrency.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">I did this by feeding closing price data from a cryptocurrency exchange API into a Multilayer Perceptron model.
      <br><br>I used the following technologies:<br>
      <ul>
      <li>CryptoCompare API</li>
      <li>NumPy library</li>
      <li>Keras library</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      </ul>
