              My name is Amir. I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/">Western University</a> with an Honours degree in Computer Science. I'm currently working as a backend developer for <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/">Shopify</a> on the Marketing Automations team.

              <br /> <br />

              The summer of 2020 I was a Software Engineering Fellow for the <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">Major League Hacking Fellowship</a>, where I worked on a <a href="https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision/pull/836">feature matching algorithm</a> for <a href="https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision">open source computer vision software</a>.

              <br /><br />

              In the past I've interned at <a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/">TD Bank</a> coding automation systems and performing high level tech infrastructure analysis.

              <br /> <br />

              I'm interested in theoretical computer science and <a href="/projects"> building cool products </a>.

              <br /> <br />

              I enjoy playing piano, swimming, and eating shawarma.
