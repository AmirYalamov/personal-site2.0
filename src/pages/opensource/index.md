# Open Source Developer

<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="/img/brutus the bee" width="120" height="120" alt="Brutus The Bee">

This summer I really wanted to improve my coding skills and gain some real world experience in software development. I decided that contibuting to open source would be the best way to address both my wishes.

I contributed towards the back-end of the <a href="https://beeware.org/zh_TW/project/projects/attic/voc/"> VOC Project </a> sector, which is a transpiler that converts Python bytecode to Java bytecode.

My contributions included implementing Python built-ins in Java, developing unit tests, and creating pull requests and resolving issues on GitHub.
