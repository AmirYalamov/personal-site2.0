I wanted to apply the knowledge and skills that I'd learned in school and make a contribution in industry. My internship at TD Bank was a great way for me not only accomplish my aim, but to also learn valuable tech and interpersonal skills as well.

I got to work on the Strategic Risk Management team in Infrastructure and Technology Solutions. I got to work on a lot of cool stuff; some of the things I did were create a script in Visual Basic that worked with Microsoft Applications and our team's intranet site to automate Senior Management processes, do some high level risk analysis on tech infrastructure control gaps, and in general learn how Risk Analysis teams work within large organizations such as one of the biggest banks in North America.
