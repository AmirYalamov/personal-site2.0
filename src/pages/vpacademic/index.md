# VP Academic

<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="/img/CSUS Logo" width="120" height="120" alt="CSUS Logo">

I wanted a way to enchance the CS community at Western, and as VP Academic for the Computer Science Undergraduate Society at Western, I got to plan out academic events and workshops that helped students excel.

Some of the events and workshops my team held included an internship panel with students who had interned at Microsoft, Google, Instagram, and RBC, A TD Bank workshop, a resume editing program, and a Microsoft Azure workshop. We also held two bar nights because we're not boring people.

As  VP Academic, I also had to lead a small team of Academic Directors to plan said events and workshops. This included delegating tasks and promoting good communication and efficiency, which often led us to finish planning for events a week in advance.
