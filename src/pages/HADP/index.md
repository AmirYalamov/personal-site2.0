# Hackers Against Dumb Posts

<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="/img/HADP Logo" width="120" height="120" alt="HADP Logo">

<p> We are all familiar with the incident of the twitter NASA girl who lost her internship due to vulgar and inappropriate tweets: <a href="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/23/10/4F5352F900000578-6090055-image-m-9_1535017175115.jpg">an example of a dumb post</a>. Our team thought she could have easily avoided this slip up, if only there was something that acted as a second wall of defense. Thus, Hackers Against Dumb Posts (HADP) was born.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">Our platform consists of an Android keyboard employing a sentiment analysis algorithm and computer vision program. Right before a user posts something, HADP will warn the user on how controversial their post might be based on phrases, topics, and media in the post. We used the following technologies: <br>
      <ul>
      <li>Flask</li>
      <li>PyTorch</li>
      <li>Clarifai API</li>
      <li>Keras</li>
      <li>Pandas</li>
      <li>Tensorflow</li>
      </ul>
