# personal-site2.0

New personal website done in Gatsby.

Steps to use:

1. Clone repo.
2. `npm install`.
3. Do whatever changes you want, then `git push` all changes.
4. `yarn deploy`. (code repo is here, but the deployemnt is on the `... .github.io`repo, to avoid conflict between deployment fiels and allow for code file remote tracking)
