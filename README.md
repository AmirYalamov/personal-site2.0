# personal-site2.0

New personal website done in Gatsby.

Steps to use:

1. Clone repo.
2. `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Do whatever changes you want, then `git push` all changes.
4. `npm run deploy` to deploy the website. This creates the build on a seperate branch called `gh-pages`.
5. Enjoy!
