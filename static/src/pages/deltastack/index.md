So far throughout my years at university, I've noticed a problem: a lot of people have a business idea or have an actual business, but don't know how to build the tech side of their venture. That's why my good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyngo1199/"> Danny Ngo</a> and I took it upon ourselves to solve this problem and created DeltaStack.

At deltaStack, we work with businesses and companies to build their tech infrastructure in a scalable and secure way. As a software engineer for deltaStack, I've build schema models for databases and worked with API endpoints to make backends for platforms, implemented secure password systems and authentication security with different libraries so we comply to industry standards, and applied Agile while running meetings and deciding on features so that we finish client projects ahead of schedule. As a co-founder, I also make executive decisions on the company's culture, financial structuring, and growth direction and strategy.


I am really excited about the future of this company; there's so much potential and I'm passionate about the work, particularly since it's something that you very much own, and it's wholly up to you how big it gets and you have full freedom over decisions.
