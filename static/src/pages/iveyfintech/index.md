# Developer Lead

<img class="align-self-center mr-3" src="/img/Ivey FinTech 2.0" width="120" height="120" alt="Ivey Fintech">

I wanted to get involved in building a real world software product and also work on my product management skills; Ivey FinTech was the stone that hit both of those birds.

I get to lead a team of developers to build a web app platform that helps Western students organize their studies. I like that I get to decide on the product's architecture and I also like that I have to work with the other developer and business leads, as well as the Vice Presidents of the portfolio.

Some of my responsabilities included directing a team of 20+ developers to build a React based course planning tool for Western students, designing project's architecture by deciding on features, frameworks, and development tools, and documenting project's development and organize teams with Jira
