I wanted to have a go at coding something a bit more low level than I'm used to in a more low level language than I'm used to. Recreating and improving upon an existing Bash shell command seemed like a good fit for my desires.</p>\n<p>This project was done to improve upon the ping command with flexibility, customization, and performance in mind. As such, C++ seemed pretty appropriate. The whole project is literally <em>just</em> C++, with a framework called <a href=\"https://github.com/taywee/args\">args</a>. On top of the standard metrics that <code class=\"language-text\">ping</code> provides like RTT, ICMP Sequence, and TTL, I have also implemented custom options for TTL, IPv6 support, the ability to specify seconds (down to the millisecond) between sending packets, and the ability to specify how many total packets to send. </p>\n<p>We used the following technologies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flask</li>\n<li>PyTorch</li>\n<li>Clarifai API</li>\n<li>Keras</li>\n<li>Pandas</li>\n<li>Tensorflow</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AmirYalamov/Surgeon-Helping-Hand\"><i class=\"fab fa-github fa-2x\"></a>"}
