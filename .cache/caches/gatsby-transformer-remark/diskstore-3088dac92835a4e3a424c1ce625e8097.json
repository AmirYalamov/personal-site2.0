Our team thought she could have easily avoided this slip up, if only there was something that acted as a second wall of defense. Thus, Hackers Against Dumb Posts (HADP) was born.</p>\n<p>Our platform consists of an Android keyboard employing a sentiment analysis algorithm and computer vision program. Right before a user posts something, HADP will warn the user on how controversial their post might be based on phrases, topics, and media in the post. We used the following technologies:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  &lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Flask&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;PyTorch&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Clarifai API&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Keras&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Pandas&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Tensorflow&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AmirYalamov/Surgeon-Helping-Hand\"><i class=\"fab fa-github fa-2x\"></a> <br>"}
