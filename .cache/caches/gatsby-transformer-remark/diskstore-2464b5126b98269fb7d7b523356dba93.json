Our team thought she could have easily avoided this slip up, if only there was something that acted as a second wall of defense. Thus, Hackers Against Dumb Posts (HADP) was born.</p>\n<p>Our platform consists of an Android keyboard employing a sentiment analysis algorithm and a computer vision program. Right before a user posts something, HADP will warn the user on how controversial their post might be based on phrases, topics, and media in the post by employing the trained algorithm from the Clarifai API by performing image analysis and natural langauge processing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/AmirYalamov/Surgeon-Helping-Hand\"><i class=\"fab fa-github fa-2x\"></a></p>"}
